1. Keep-it-simple-stupid. No overengineering, no unnecessary features, minimalistic UI.
2. Privacy-first. No personal data collection, GDPR compliance, anonymity guarantees.
3. Transparency. Open-source code, clear communication about data handling and project goals.
4. Community-driven. Empower citizens to report violations, involve local authorities.
5. Boomer tech over cutting edge. The app should be easy to debug, maintain an extend. 
6. Business over tech. Focus on solving the problem, not on using the latest technologies or frameworks.
7. Fast iteration. The first MVP should be developed in 3h.
